\section{Chapter 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A young boy is on a lagoon. A fat boy cries that he's caught up in creepers and thorns.
	\item There are no grown-up on the island. The kids are dropped by a pilot that couldn't land on the island.
	\item Protagonist: Ralph
	\item Ralph is about twelve years old.
	\item Ralph is very mean to the fat boy. He's calling him names (Piggy).
	\item Ralph seems happy.
	\item Ralph and Piggy are swimming in a warm pool.
	\item Ralph proudly says that his father is a commander in the navy. He would come and rescue them.
	\item Piggy's father is dead. He lived with his auntie in a Sweet shop.
	\item All at the airport are dead (Ralph's father included) because of atom bomb (?). So nobody knows they're stranded.
	\item They are searching for the other kids.
	\item Ralph finds a conch (Schneckenmuschel). It has value due to memories of his mother.
	\item Piggy uses the conch to call the others by "spitting" in it.
	\item A kid appears from the palms. His name is Johnny. Other kids are following (Sam, Eric, ...). All are half naked or fully naked. Then a big group of other kids appears from the jungle.
	\item Every kid wears a black cap with a silver badge, except the leader who wears a black cap with a golden badge. They all wear a black cloak.
	\item The leader is ugly faced. His name is Jack Merridew. He has authority.
	\item Piggy is being bullied by the group and Ralph.
	\item Names are being exchanged: Maurice, Bill, Roger, Robert, Harold, Henry and Simon.
	\item A leader is voted. Piggy is the most intelligent, the most obvious leader is Jack but Ralph is tall and has possession of the conch. It's Ralph. The choir still belongs to Jack. They are from now on the hunters.
	\item Ralph, Jack and Simon are going on a mission to find out if they're on an island. Piggy is rejected.
	\item They are climbing a mountain. (On the track they push down a big rock.) On the summit they see the sea all around them. But somehow they are happy. This island belongs to them. They are happy and friends.
	\item The three become hungry and start to look for prey. Jack stabbed a pick that fell down a cliff.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ralph makes a meeting with everyone to say that they're on an island and there needs to be a group of hunters, an army.
	\item Piggy says that nobody knows that they are on this island and that they will be on this island for maybe a very long time. But Ralph says that they will have fun until the grown-ups come.
	\item A little boy tells about the big snake that wanted to kill him. No one is believing him.
	\item Jack says that the army would kill this snake if they'll see it. But Ralph says aggressively that there isn't a beast. (Why does he not want to talk about the snake?)
